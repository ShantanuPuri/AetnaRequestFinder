MEDICALLY NECESSARY 

GREATER OR LESSER SAPHENOUS VEINS 
Stripping and Ligation, Endovenous Radiofrequency Ablation (ERFA), or Endovenous Laser Ablation Therapy (EVLT)

The treatment of symptomatic greater or lesser saphenous varicose veins/chronic venous insufficiency by stripping and ligation, endovenous radiofrequency ablation (ERFA), or endovenous laser ablation therapy (EVLT), is considered medically necessary and, therefore, covered when ALL of the following criteria are met:

Documented evidence of one or more of the following symptomatic conditions: 

Non-healing ulceration secondary to venous stasis adjacent to an identified incompetent varicosity of truncal or perforator vein
Recurrent superficial thrombophlebitis in dilated incompetent veins or clusters
Hemorrhage or recurrent bleeding episodes from a ruptured superficial varicosity requiring at least one of the following: 

Medical or surgical intervention
Compensation for blood loss anemia
Documented aneurysmal formation with skin and vein wall fusion (pre-rupture)

Persistent pain, swelling, itching, burning, or other symptoms are associated with saphenous reflux and the symptoms significantly interfere with activities of daily living (e.g., mobility).

A documented three-month trial of conservative medical management, including the use of graduated, elastic compression stockings* (with instructions on their use), mild exercise, periodic leg elevation, avoidance of long periods of standing, weight reduction as appropriate, and analgesia for symptom relief, has failed in managing (or controlling) symptoms.  

Compression stockings are defined as graduated elasticized compression stockings. Use of non-graduated compression garments such as support pantyhose does not fulfill this requirement. Lack of compliance with compression stockings does not support the need for intervention without documentation of other failed conservative treatments as well.
*Note: Refer to the applicable medical policy that addresses coverage criteria for compression stockings. Three-month trial of conservative medical management is not required for individuals with Clinical, Etiology, Anatomy, Pathophysiology (CEAP) C5 or C6 (See guidelines section).

Assessment of the lower extremity venous system by duplex studies that show the anatomy, size, and tortuosity of the greater and lesser saphenous vein, within the last six months. These studies must demonstrate ALL of the following:

Presence and patency of the deep venous system
Absence of large chronic thrombosis
Greater and/or lesser saphenous vein incompetence/reflux  (i.e., reflux greater than 0.5 second duration) that correlates with the individual's symptoms
Greater and/or lesser saphenous vein diameters

Greater saphenous vein diameter is 5 mm to 20 mm (unless documented by the supplier of the device to exceed 20 mm)
Lesser saphenous vein diameter is 4 mm to 20 mm (unless documented by the supplier of the device to exceed 20 mm)


There is absence of clinically significant or symptomatic peripheral arterial insufficiency in the region of the treatment.
There is no planned treatment of incompetent valves or risk of direct injury to perforator veins of the calf that may induce thrombus propagation into the deep vein system.
ERFA or EVLT for the treatment of symptomatic greater or lesser saphenous veins, ALL of the following criteria must also be met:

The anatomy is amenable to one of these procedures and there is absence of vein tortuosity that would impair catheter advancement and distance separation from skin as to preclude thermal injury
The saphenous vein(s) are nonaneurysmal.	
ERFA, EVLT for the treatment of the greater saphenous vein must include the portion above and below the knee. This is part of the planned surgery, and therefore ablation of portion above and below the knee is not eligible for separate payment. 


Repeat Treatments

Repeat procedures of the greater or lesser saphenous vein are considered medically necessary and, therefore, covered, when, in addition to the above criteria, a repeat duplex study has been performed since the last procedure and demonstrates saphenous reflux.

DUPLICATE GREATER SAPHENOUS VEINS

Stripping and Ligation, ERFA, or EVLT

Stripping and ligation, ERFA, or EVLT of symptomatic duplicate greater saphenous varicose veins/chronic venous insufficiency is considered medically necessary and, therefore, covered when ALL of the above criteria for greater saphenous veins are met.

ACCESSORY SAPHENOUS VEINS

Stripping and Ligation, ERFA, EVLT, Ambulatory Phlebectomy/Stab Phlebectomy, or Sclerotherapy 

The treatment of symptomatic accessory saphenous varicose veins/chronic venous insufficiency by stripping and ligation, ERFA, EVLT, ambulatory phlebectomy/stab phlebectomy, or sclerotherapy with injectable liquid or microfoam followed by compression is considered medically necessary and, therefore, covered when ALL of the following criteria are met:

One of the following procedures is performed:

Stripping and ligation, ERFA, EVLT, or sclerotherapy with injectable liquid or microfoam followed by compression for the treatment of accessory saphenous veins, when incompetence of the accessory saphenous vein is isolated or the greater or lesser saphenous veins have been previously eliminated for at least three months.
Ambulatory phlebectomy/stab phlebectomy for the treatment of accessory saphenous veins, is performed with or without previous elimination of the greater or lesser saphenous veins.
ERFA or EVLT, for the treatment of accessory saphenous veins, requires that ALL of the following criteria must also be met:

The accessory saphenous vein diameter is 5mm or greater
The anatomy is amenable to one of these procedures and there is absence of vein tortuosity that would impair catheter advancement and distance separation from skin as to preclude thermal injury.
The accessory saphenous vein(s) are nonaneurysmal.


Documented evidence of one or more of the following symptomatic conditions: 

Non-healing ulceration secondary to venous stasis adjacent to an identified incompetent varicosity
Recurrent superficial thrombophlebitis in dilated incompetent veins or clusters 
Hemorrhage or recurrent bleeding episodes from a ruptured superficial varicosity requiring at least one of the following:

Medical or surgical intervention
Compensation for blood loss anemia
Documented aneurysmal formation with skin and vein wall fusion (i.e., pre-rupture)  

Persistent pain, swelling, itching, burning, or other symptoms are associated with saphenous reflux and the symptoms significantly interfere with activities of daily living (e.g., mobility).

A documented three-month trial of conservative medical management, including the use of graduated, elastic compression stockings* (with instructions on their use), mild exercise, periodic leg elevation, avoidance of long periods of standing, weight reduction as appropriate, and analgesia for symptom relief, has failed in managing (or controlling) symptoms.  

Compression stockings are defined as graduated elasticized compression stockings. Use of non-graduated compression garments such as support pantyhose does not fulfill this requirement. Lack of compliance with compression stockings does not support the need for intervention without documentation of other failed conservative treatments as well. 
*Note: Refer to the applicable medical policy that addresses coverage criteria for compression stockings. Three-month trial of conservative medical management is not required for individuals with Clinical, Etiology, Anatomy, Pathophysiology (CEAP) C5 or C6 (See guidelines section).

In rare circumstances, multiple-stage procedures using EVRA or EVLT of the same vein may be considered medically necessary. An additional duplex ultrasound study and review by the Company are required.

Under most circumstances, repeat procedures of EVRA or EVLT are not medically necessary. In rare circumstances, recanalization of a tributary vein treated with EVRA or EVLT may occur and therefore may be considered medically necessary.

additional duplex ultrasound study and review by the Company are required.

SCLEROTHERAPY
Sclerotherapy with injectable liquid or microfoam followed by compression is considered not medically necessary for treatment of large veins greater than 6 mm diameter or for greater or lesser saphenous veins. 

ECHOSCLEROTHERAPY
Because ultrasound-monitored or duplex-guided techniques for sclerotherapy injectable liquid or microfoam followed by compression of varicose veins (echosclerotherapy) have not been shown to definitively increase the effectiveness or safety of this procedure, echosclerotherapy is considered not medically necessary and, therefore, not covered for the treatment of varicose veins of the lower extremities.

US FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA)

The FDA approved the marketing of the VNUS ClosureÂ® System in March 1999; since 2002, various other laser systems (e.g., Diomed 810-nm Surgical Laser) have also been approved.

In October 2003, the FDA approved the marketing of the Smith & Nephew TriVex System, which is indicated for use in ambulatory phlebectomy procedures for the resection and ablation of varicose veins.

In March 2008, the FDA approved the marketing of the Vascular Insights ClariVeinâ„¢ Infusion Catheter, which is indicated for use in the infusion of specified agents in the peripheral vasculature.

Subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery (SEPS) as a procedure is not regulated by the FDA. However, the FDA has approved several devices for use in a variety of minimally invasive procedures (such as SEPS) to facilitate grasping, mobilization, dissection, and transaction of tissue. 

There are numerous products approved by the FDA as sclerosing agents. For example, sodium tetradecyl sulfate (SotradecolÂ®), which was approved by the FDA in 2004 to treat small uncomplicated varicose veins of the lower extremities that show simple dilation with competent valves and polidocanol (AscleraÂ®), was approved by the FDA in 2010 as a sclerosing agent indicated to treat uncomplicated spider veins (varicose veins 1mm or less in diameter) and uncomplicated reticular veins (varicose veins 1mm to 3mm in diameter).

Description -->  Description


VARICOSE VEINS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITIES 

The venous system of the lower extremities consists of deep and superficial veins. The deep venous system consists of the popliteal and femoral veins. The superficial venous system consists of greater and lesser saphenous veins, accessory veins, rare variant duplicate greater saphenous veins (veins that travel in parallel with the greater and lesser saphenous veins). Perforator veins cross through the fascia and connect these deep and superficial systems.  One-way valves are present at the junction between the bifurcation point of the two systems (i.e., the saphenofemoral and the saphenopopliteal junction). Varicose veins are dilated, tortuous, superficial vessels that result from defective valves within the saphenous veins, from intrinsic weakness of the vein wall, from high intraluminal pressure, or, on rare occasions, from arteriovenous fistulas. Varicose veins of the lower extremities protrude from the skin surface in a rope-like manner.

Many varicose veins are asymptomatic. However, when present, symptoms of varicose veins of the lower extremities include pain, aching, burning, cramping, itching, and/or swelling. Varicose veins of the lower extremities may be complicated by peripheral edema due to venous insufficiency, hemorrhage, or thrombophlebitis. Additional complications may include venous ulceration, chronic skin ulceration, and skin changes.  

The term "varicose veins" does not include telangiectatic dermal vessels (e.g., "spider veins" or "broken blood vessels"). Spider veins (also known as telangiectases) have a web-like appearance on the surface of the skin. The primary difference between spider veins and varicose veins is that spider veins lack varicose vein symptomatology. Treatment of these superficial veins is usually provided for cosmetic reasons. Cosmetic services are those provided to improve an individual's physical appearance, from which no significant improvement in physiologic function can be expected. Emotional and/or psychological improvement alone does not constitute improvement in physiologic function. 

Varicose veins are initially treated by conservative medical methods such as graduated, elastic compression stockings, mild exercise, periodic leg elevation, avoidance of long periods of standing, weight loss as appropriate, and analgesia for symptom relief. Additional treatment options may include stripping and ligation, endovenous radiofrequency ablation (ERFA), endovenous laser ablation therapy (EVLT), stab phlebectomy, sclerotherapy, transilluminated powered phlebectomy (TIPP), and subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery (SEPS).

CEAP CLASSIFICATION 
Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology (CEAP) classification of lower extremity chronic venous disorders has been developed to serve as a basis for standardized reporting. It classifies lower extremity venous disease based upon clinical signs, etiology, anatomic location, and pathophysiologic abnormality.

The visible signs of chronic venous disorders are categorized as a class 0 (no visible sign of disease) to class 6 (active ulceration).

TREATMENT OF VARICOSE VEINS
Stripping and Ligation

Stripping and ligation involves tying off and removing the greater or lesser saphenous vein and its tributaries. Most of the visible varicosities can then be removed either by multiple incisions or by sclerotherapy.  

Endovenous Radiofrequency Ablation (EFRA)

Endovenous radiofrequency ablation (EFRA) of the greater saphenous vein is another minimally invasive alternative to vein stripping and ligation. This method damages the intimal wall of the vessel by delivering high-frequency radiowaves via a specially designed catheter. Heat produced by these radiowaves collapses the vein, causing the vessel to close upon slow withdrawal of the catheter. The VNUS ClosureÂ® System (VNUS Medical Technologies, Inc., San Jose, CA) is a radiofrequency device that is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the endovascular coagulation of blood vessels in individuals with superficial vein reflux.

Endovenous Laser Ablation (EVLT)

Endovenous laser ablation therapy (EVLT) of the saphenous veins is a minimally invasive alternative to vein stripping and ligation. Under ultrasound guidance, a bare-tipped laser is introduced into the greater saphenous vein, activated, and slowly withdrawn, causing the vessel to collapse. The Diomed 810-nm Surgical Laser and Endovenous Laser Therapy (EVLTÂ®) Procedure Kit (Diomed, Inc., Andover, MA) are approved by the FDA for the endovascular coagulation of blood vessels in individuals with superficial vein reflux.

Endovenous Mechanochemical Ablation

Endovenous mechanochemical ablation (e.g., Clariveinâ„¢ [Vascular Insights, Madision, CT]) is a minimally invasive treatment for varicose veins, combining mechanical and chemical modalities.  The procedure involves the use of a special percutaneous infusion catheter, which contains a rotating wire, providing endovenous mechanical destruction. Simultaneously, an FDA-approved sclerosing agent (e.g., sodium tetradecyl sulfate) is administered in order to enhance occlusion of the vein. Currently, there are ongoing clinical trials involving endovenous mechanochemical ablation versus EFRA. To date, the evidence of endovenous mechanochemical ablation incudes a randomized controlled trial with 117 individuals with short-term follow-up of six months. Loss to follow-up was greater than 20 percent at one and six months across both study arms (Lane 2017). These short-term results suggest that intraprocedural pain is slightly lower with endovenous mechanochemical ablation than with EFRA. However, endovenous mechanochemical ablation has been assessed in relatively few individuals and for short durations. Longer follow-up is needed to evaluate the efficacy and durability of this procedure compared to established procedures. 

The systematic review from National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE 2016) includes clinical practice guidance. Guidelines recommend use of endovenous mechanochemical ablation for the treatment of varicose veins, although they noted that a longer-term follow-up data are needed.  The authors did not use a formal quality assessment tool, but noted that the estimate of efficacy for the procedures was limited by short follow-up periods (two years at most) and variations in chemical agents and dosage within and across studies.

Reported limitations of the available evidence include sample sizes, reliance on nonrandomized studies, heterogeneity in protocols for the chemical component and industry funding. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes.

Stab Phlebectomy

Stab phlebectomy is a technique of removing varicose veins through multiple small incisions. Stab phlebectomy may be performed in conjunction with stripping and ligation. 

Transilluminated Powered Phlebectomy

Transilluminated powered phlebectomy (e.g., Smith & Nephew TriVex System, [Smith & Nephew, Inc., Andover, MA]) is a minimally invasive procedure in which an endoscopic illuminator is inserted into the vein to allow visualization of the varicose vein clusters. The veins are then ablated using a vein resector. During destruction of the veins, the debris is removed from the wound using suction.

Sclerotherapy

Sclerotherapy involves the destruction of the endothelium (or lining) of the targeted vessels by injection of a sclerosing solution. The accuracy of the injection, an adequate volume of injectant, and the concentration of the sclerosant determine the success of the treatment. Larger veins (greater than 6 mm diameter or the main saphenous veins), and very tortuous veins may not be good candidates for this therapy. Sclerotherapy can be performed in conjunction with surgical treatment of varicose veins of the lower extremities. The sclerotherapy agents currently available are classed by their actions in causing endothelial damage: osmotic or detergent agents. Osmotic agents achieve their effect by dehydrating endothelial cells through osmosis. Hypertonic saline and glycerin are two types of osmotic agents; however, glycerin is currently not commercially available in the United States. Sodium tetradecyl sulfate (SotradecolÂ®) and polidocanol (AscleraÂ®) are detergent agents, which are surface active agents that cause endothelial damage by interfering with cell membrane lipids. In review of available published literature, a systematic review of 17 randomized controlled trials of injection sclerotherapy for varicosities of varying size found no evidence to support use of one sclerosant over another in the short-term success of sclerotherapy. 

In addition to sclerotherapy's use in conjunction with surgical treatment, EVLT and EFRA, it may be utilized solely for aesthetic or cosmetic purposes, an instance being for the treatment of telangiectasia (spider veins). Cosmetic services are those provided to improve an individual's physical appearance, from which no significant improvement in physiological function can be expected. Emotional and/or psychological improvement alone does not constitute improvement in physiological function. For example, polidocanol (AscleraÂ®) has potential to be used solely for cosmetic purposes because it was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as a sclerosing agent indicated to treat uncomplicated spider veins (varicose veins 1mm or less in diameter) and uncomplicated reticular veins (varicose veins 1mm to 3mm in diameter); polidocanol (AscleraÂ®) has not been studied in varicose veins larger than 3 mm.

Sclerotherapy using a liquid sclerosing agent has traditionally been the gold standard; however, foam sclerosing agents are becoming more popular. Foam sclerosants are produced by forcibly mixing a gas (e.g., air, carbon dioxide) with a liquid sclerosant (i.e., polidocanol, sodium tetradecyl sulfate), allowing for a larger surface area of exposure. The expanded volume of the foam compared with liquid agents has exhibited more surface contact, a more uniform vessel closure, and the need for smaller volumes of sclerosant. The rates of occlusion with the FDA-approved microfoam scleroherapy are similar to those reported for endovenous laser ablation or stripping. Varithenaâ„¢ (formerly known as VarisolveÂ®, BTG PLC, London) is a sclerosant microfoam made with proprietary gas mix.  Varithenaâ„¢ received FDA approval in 2013, under a new drug application (NDA) for the treatment of incompetent great saphenous veins, accessory saphenous veins, and visible varicosities of the great saphenous vein system above and below the knee.

Cyanoacrylate Adhesive

Cyanoacrylate adhesive is a clear, free-flowing liquid that polymerizes in the vessel via an anionic mechanism (i.e., polymerizes into a solid material upon contact with body fluids or tissue). Under local anesthesia, the adhesive is gradually injected along the length of the vein in conjunction with ultrasound and manual compression. The acute coaptation halts blood flow through the vein until the implanted adhesive, typically delivered in measured doses becomes fibrotically encapsulated and establishes chronic occlusion of the treated vein. 

The VenaSealÂ® Closure System (Sapheon, a part of Medtronic), which seals the vein using cyanoacrylate adhesive agent, received FDA approval in 2015 for the permanent closure of clinically significant venous reflux through endovascular embolization with coaptation. However, evidence on cyanoacrylate adhesive for the treatment of varicose veins and venous insufficiency includes a multicenter noninferiority trial with three months of follow-up and case series with longer follow-up. The short-term efficacy of cyanoacrylate adhesive has been shown to be noninferior to EFRA at three months. Longer follow-up in trials with a larger number of individuals is needed to determine durability of this treatment. 

Gibson and Ferris (2017) reported results of the prospective WAVES study of cyanoacrylate closure for the treatment of great saphenous veins, small saphenous veins, and/or accessory saphenous veins up to 20 mm in diameter (n=50). Compression stockings post-procedure were not utilized. Participants returned at one week and one month for follow-up. All treated veins (48 great saphenous vein, 14 accessory saphenous veins, and 8 small saphenous veins) had complete closure by duplex ultrasound at seven days and one month. Mean time to return to work and normal activities was 0.2 Â± 1.1 and 2.4 Â± 4.1 days, respectively. The revised venous clinical severity score was improved to 1.8 Â± 1.4 (p < .001) and Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire score to 8.9 Â± 6.6 (p < .001) at one month. Phlebitis in the treatment area or side branches occurred in ten subjects (20 percent) and completely resolved in all but one subject (2 percent) by one month. The authors concluded that cyanoacrylate closure is safe and effective for the treatment of one or more incompetent saphenous or accessory saphenous veins, closure rates were high even in the absence of the use of compression stockings or side branch treatment. Time back to work or normal activities was short and improvements in venous severity scores and QOL were in the authorsâ€™ opinion significant, comparing favorably with alternative treatment methods. Randomized controlled trials with a larger number of individuals and longer follow-up periods are needed to validate findings. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes.

Cryoablation 

Cryoablation uses extreme cold to cause injury to the vessel, causing retraction and subsequent fibrotic occlusion to the vein. For individuals who have varicose veins/venous insufficiency and saphenous vein reflux who receive cryoablation, the evidence includes RCTs and multicenter series. Relevant outcomes are symptoms, change in disease status, morbid events, quality of life, and treatment-related morbidity. Results from a recent RCT of cryoablation have indicated that this therapy is inferior to conventional stripping. Studies showing a benefit on health outcomes are needed. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes.

Echosclerotherapy

Echosclerotherapy utilizes duplex ultrasound to guide the injection of the sclerosing solution and to enhance the precision of saphenous vein sclerotherapy. The use of duplex-guided ultrasound for sclerotherapy of varicose veins of the lower extremities has not been shown to definitively increase the effectiveness or safety of this procedure. There is very little published medical literature on the use of echosclerotherapy, and no large long-term outcomes have been reported. 

PERFORATOR VEINS AND TREATMENT OF INCOMPETENCE

Perforator veins are an irregular group of veins that grow as tributaries of the greater saphenous veins and connect the superficial venous system to the deep venous system. They permit the unidirectional flow of blood from the superficial to the deep venous system through a set of one-way valves. These valves can become incompetent and have been linked to chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), which is characterized by induration and inflammation of the skin and subcutaneous tissues, as well as microvascular stasis that ultimately leads to tissue destruction and chronic ulceration. 

TREATMENT OF PERFORATOR VEIN INCOMPETENCE 
Surgical treatment of incompetent perforator veins as a treatment for CVI can be performed by an open approach, endoscopic approach, or by endovenous radiofrequency or laser ablation. The original treatment approach was the Linton procedure, an open approach, which involved a long medial calf incision to expose posterior, medial, and paramedial perforators. This procedure was associated with the healing of ulcers but, over time, has been largely abandoned due to incidences of wound complications. As a result, the Linton procedure's approach was modified to a series of perpendicular skin flaps instead of a longitudinal skin flap to provide access to incompetent perforator veins in the lower part of the leg. This modified Linton procedure may be used for the closure of incompetent perforator veins that cannot be accessed by less invasive procedures. Subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery (SEPS) is a minimally invasive procedure whereby duplex ultrasound guidance is used, and small incisions are made in the skin. Using endoscopic techniques, the perforator veins are clipped or divided by endoscopic scissors. EFRA and EVLT are utilized in a similar fashion as with incompetent saphenous veins, as described above.
